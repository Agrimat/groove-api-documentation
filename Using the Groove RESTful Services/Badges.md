#Badges
Badges are Windows Store branded artwork that you can use to advertise
Groove music products but also apps, games, movies and TV shows. 
Added directly to your site, these images capture attention and give additional credibility to your promotions. 
When used in conjunction with the affiliate link, the artwork clearly conveys that the product is available to download from the Windows 
Store, helping to drive additional clicks and commissions. 
You can access badges through the [badge creator page. ](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/publish/windows-store-badges)
