#Streaming music
You can get access to a 30-second sample of all the music tracks. See [/1/content/{id}/preview].
You don't need an authenticated user to access previews.  

To stream a full music track you need an authenticated user.
See [User Authentication] for more details on how to authenticate users.
Once you have a user token, you can stream full music tracks. See [/1/content/{id}/stream].
