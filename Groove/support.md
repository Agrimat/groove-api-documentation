# Support
First, please check that your question is not already answered in the [FAQ](FAQ.md).   

If this did not solve your concern, you can contact ```xboxmusicdevapi@microsoft.com``` to ask questions, provide feedback, or raise any issue.

## Data to provide
When contacting the API team, please make sure you provide enough data to allow us to efficiently troubleshoot your problem.

If your problem involves a specific API request, please send us a [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) trace containing the request and response.

If for some reason you cannot provide such a trace, please include the request and response details. You should at least include the response "MS-CV" header value and the timestamp of the issue (in UTC time).
